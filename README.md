# Cosine-Levitation-Next-Gen-Anti-Gravity-at-200.90-
Key is Cos(1:400)! Cosine Levitation where flight can occur at the minimum of 400. Running the proof 4 times for v8 cosine levitation engines!
Once Frames per second achieves 400 in one window or 50 if four windows

Cosine Levitation does not need fuel using the key cos(1:400) any gas in the engine would be used to create 400 times any weight such as 78 billion metric tons in a unknown atmosphere would not need fuel after 20 frames per second
